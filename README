This is the procd for the OpenWrt Linux distribution for HENI's CherryMote.

Forked from http://git.openwrt.org/?p=project/procd.git


=== Our changes ===
# watchdog:
* Every 60 seconds (configurable) a watchdog-client is run.
  The device is restarted by the hardware watchdog (we stop scheduling to ping it)
  when the watchdog-client exits with status 64 or when it exits with another
  non zero status 15 times (configurable) in a row.
